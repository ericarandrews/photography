Photography Study Guide

Camera

1.) What is the ISO setting? 

ISO speed (100, 200, 400, and so on) describes a sensor’s (or film’s) sensitivity to light. 
What are the typical ISO settings? The higher the number, 
the less light it needs for a correct exposure (for a picture that is not too light or too dark). 
With a digital camera, you may select an ISO setting within that camera’s range. 
You may choose a different ISO for each picture, or you may set your camera to do so automatically. 
Lower numbers will generally result in higher-quality pictures. 
Set an ISO of 50-800 for shooting outdoors in sunny conditions. 
In dimmer light, such as indoors, use an ISO of 800 or higher. 
Film is made with a fixed ISO; an entire roll must be exposed at that speed; 
400 speed film is a good all-purpose choice. 

2.) What are the visual characteristics of fast vs. slow ISOs? 

Fast (Higher) vs Slow (Lower) ISOs, on a digital camera, 
will change either aperture or shutter speed but will not make the picture lighter or darker. 
(Instead, you will need to use the button, dial, or menu item that controls exposure compensation. 
You can set the camera to expose all your photographs at a fixed amount more or less than the meter indicates, 
or you can make an exposure change for one picture at a time.)

In a digital photograph, the lower the light, the more the noise. Higher ISO settings increase noise. 
Therefore, the higher (faster) the ISO, the lower the light. With a higher ISO, 
you shoot with a smaller aperture or higher shutter speed. 
The kinds of noise that are always present at a low level are then amplified more than they would be at a lower ISO, 
and form a more noticeable part of the image.

Setting the ISO on a film camera doesn’t change the light sensitivity of the film, 
so you can change the exposure (if the camera allows you to set an ISO manually) by changing the film speed setting. 
The camera responds as if the film were slower or faster than it really is. Doubling the film speed (for example, 
from ISO 100 to ISO 200) darkens the picture by decreasing the exposure one stop. 
Halving the film speed (say from ISO 400 to ISO 200) lightens the picture by increasing the exposure one stop. 

3.) What does the shutter speed control? 

The shutter speed determines the length of time that light strikes the sensor. 
Moving objects can be shown crisply sharp, frozen in mid motion, or blurred either a little bit or a lot. 
The faster (higher) the shutter speed, the sharper the moving object will appear. 
To make the correct exposure, so that your picture is neither too light nor too dark, 
you need to control the amount of light that reaches the digital image sensors (or film). 
The shutter speed (the amount of time the shutter remains open) is one of two controls your camera has over the amount of light. 
The aperture size is the other. In addition to controlling the amount of light that enters the camera, 
the shutter speed also affects the way that moving objects are shown. 

4.) What are the visual differences of 1/30 vs 1/1000? 

1/30 - (Slow to Medium Shutter Speed) - The background will be slightly fuzzy but the middle ground might appear in focus. 
Any moving objects in front might show a little blur.   

1/1000 - (Fast Shutter Speed) - The background will definitely be out of focus and the middle ground will be blurred. 
Any moving objects in front will be sharp and any objects in front should be sharp as well.

5.) What is Bracketing? 

Taking several photographs of the same scene at different exposure settings, 
some greater than and some less than the setting indicated by the meter, to ensure at least one well-exposed frame.

Bracketing produces lighter and darker versions of the same scene. Bracketing helps if you are not sure about the exposure. 

To bracket, you make several photographs of the same scene, increasing and decreasing the exposure by adjusting the aperture or shutter speed. 

To bracket, first make an exposure with the aperture and shutter speed set by the automatic system or manually set by you at the combination you think is the right one. 
Then make a second shot with one stop more exposure and a third shot with one stop less exposure. 

This is easy to do if you set the exposure manually: 
For one stop more exposure either set the shutter to the next slower speed or the aperture to the next larger opening (the next smaller f-number); 
For one stop less exposure, either set the shutter to the next faster speed or the aperture to the next smaller opening (the next larger f-number);
In automatic operation, if you change to the next larger aperture, the camera may simply shift to the next faster shutter speed, resulting in the same overall exposure. 
Instead, you have to override the camera’s automatic system.

6.) What is “panning”?

Panning to show motion.
Panning the camera - moving it in the same direction as the subject’s movement during the exposure - is another way of showing motion. The background will be blurred, 
but the subject will be sharper than it would be if the camera were held steady. 

7.) What is Camera RAW?

One of several proprietary file formats that preserve all the data from a digital camera picture with no after-capture interpretation. 

You can save your files in their original form (raw files). The file as it is captured by your camera or scanner is often referred to as a raw file, 
as opposed to a derivative file - one that has been processed, altered, edited, or changed in some way. 
A Camera Raw file is a specific kind of raw file that holds all the information captured by a digital camera’s sensor, in a completely unprocessed form. 
If you have instead set your camera to capture images and save them as TIFF files or JPEGS, those original files can be considered raw files as well.

Understanding and using Camera Raw files can make your photographs better. A digitally captured picture is only abstract data until it is interpreted to look like the scene you photographed. 
If your camera can save Camera Raw files, you can interpret the data yourself later. It is easy to do, gives you more control, and can produce a higher-quality final image.

For the best results, capture your pictures in Camera Raw format which lets you control the interpretation of sensor data during editing. 
The white balance adjustment is part of the processing that is applied to raw sensor data after capture, 
so you can compensate at that time for the effects of different light sources without degrading the quality of your image. 
If your camera captures in JPEG or TIFF format, white balance is applied by the camera. 

8.) How would you describe a JPEG vs. a RAW file?

Camera Raw files preserve all the capture data with no loss. If you are using TIFF or JPEG files from your camera, you are accepting the camera’s interpretation of what its sensor captured, 
along with some loss of original data. If your camera lets you download raw files in the camera’s own format,  you can then control the interpretation of sensor data (color balance, 
tonal relationships, etc.), tailoring it to make an image file that is exactly what you want.

Camera RAW files are larger than JPEG files; you can hold more JPEGs on a memory card than RAW files.

Camera RAW files require specific software to open while JPEG files can usually be opened by most software. 

JPEG files, 

(.CR2, .NEF, .PEF, etc...) files that do not conform to a single set of standards like JPEGs or TIFFs. 
Raw is a generic term for the individual and proprietary way that a digital camera produces unprocessed data, 
before settings like white balance are applied. Starting with a raw file allows more precise editing control and lets you keep your pictures in the high-bit (12 or 16 bits per pixel) 
format that better digital cameras capture. You can open raw files with software from the camera manufacturer, but try your editing software first.

(.jpg), written as a JPEG, compresses photos into a smaller file. You can choose one of several quality levels for progressively smaller files; 
a low quality may allow an image saved as a JPEG to be reduced to as little as one-twentieth its original size. This kind of compression, which discards information, is called lossy. 
Every time you open and resave a JPEG its quality deteriorates; choose another format for editing. JPEGs, with smaller file sizes making faster transmission times, 
are common for displaying photographs on the Web or sending snapshots over the Internet. Digital cameras offer this format as a file option to fit more photographs on a memory card. 
A JPEG can only hold an 8-bit pixel depth.

Most digital cameras can only save in one or both of these formats, TIFF or JPEG files.

If your camera is shooting Camera Raw files, this gives you a better chance at retrieving an image that was slightly over-or underexposed. 

If your camera is capturing TIFF or JPEG files, you have a little leeway, capturing the correct exposure.

9.) What is composition?

How a photograph is “put together”....

Put simply, composition is how the elements of a photo are arranged. ... A good photograph will take many different parts and combine them into an aesthetically pleasing whole. 
Composition is how an artist tells a story within the confines of a single frame.

Compositional Techniques
- Rule of Thirds
The rule of thirds is a composition guide that states that arranging the important features of an image on or near the horizontal and vertical lines that would divide the image 
into thirds horizontally and vertically is visually pleasing. The objective is to stop the subjects and areas of interest (such as the horizon) from bisecting the image, 
by placing them near one of the lines that would divide the image into three equal columns and rows, ideally near the intersection of those lines.
- Rule of Odds
- Rule of Space
- Simplification
- Shallow Depth of Field
In photography, and also (via software simulation of real lens limitations) in 3D graphics, 
one approach to achieving simplification is to use a wide aperture when shooting to limit the depth of field. When used properly in the right setting, 
this technique can place everything that is not the subject of the photograph out of focus.
- Geometry and Symmetry
- Creating Movement
- Other Techniques
        
10.) What is quality of light?

Light can range from direct and contrasty to diffused and soft, whether indoors or out.

Direct Light - Direct Light is high in contrast. It creates bright highlights and dark shadows with hard, or sharp, edges. 
Photographic materials, both digital and film, have limited dynamic range (latitude) and cannot record details in very light and very dark areas at the same time. 
Directly lit areas may appear brilliant and bold, with shadowed ones almost entirely black. If you are photographing in direct light, you may want to add fill light to lighten shadows. 
Because direct light is often quite bright, you can use a small aperture to give plenty of depth of field, a fast shutter speed to stop motion, or both, if the light is bright enough. 
The sun on a clear day is a common source of direct light. Indoors, a flash or photo lamp pointed directly at your subject (that is, not bounced off another surface) also provide direct light. 

Directional/Diffused Light - Directional/Diffused light is intermediate in contrast. It is partly direct and partly diffused. 
Shadows are present, but they are softer and not as dark as those caused by direct light. 
You will encounter directional/diffused light on a hazy day when the sun’s rays are somewhat scattered so light comes from the surrounding sky as well as from the sun. 
A shaded area, such as under trees or along the shady side of a building, can have directional/diffused light if the light is bouncing onto the scene primarily from one direction. 
Indoors, a skylight or other large window can give this type of light if the sun is not shining directly on the subject. 
Light from a flash or photo lamp can also be directional/diffused if it is softened by a translucent diffusing material 
placed in front of thelight or if it is bounced off another surface such as a wall or an umbrella reflector.

Diffused Light - Diffused Light is low in contrast. It bathes subjects in light from all sides so that shadows are weak or even absent. 
Colors are less brilliant than they are in direct light and are likely to be pastel or muted in tone. Because diffused light is likely to be dimmer than direct light, 
you might not be able to use a small aperture with a fast shutter speed. 
A heavily overcast day creates diffused light because the light is cast evenly by the whole dome of the sky rather than,
as it is on a sunny day, mostly by the small disk of the sun. Indoors, diffused light can be created with a very broad source of light used close to the subject 
(such as light bounced into a large umbrella reflector)plus additional fill light (or a Softbox - another broad source - used in a lighting setup).

11.) What is contrast?

The difference between the light and dark parts of a scene or photograph. 

Two kinds of contrast are important in a photograph; both are established by the kind of illumination on the scene and can be altered by your technique. 

Overall (or global) contrast, or dynamic range, is the difference between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene or image. The range you can capture varies; 
all films and digital sensors have different limits on the range that can be captured. 

Local contrast is what makes photographs look crisp or soft, and has to do with the edges and transitions of color and tone. 
It is affected by the quality of the lens (and how clean that lens is), the kind of film or sensor used, and by digital editing.

High-contrast scenes are difficult to expose correctly because the range of tones in a contrasty scene (also called a scene of wide or high dynamic range) 
can meet or even exceed the latitude (the range of tones that can be captured simultaneously) of the sensor or film.
Even a small exposure error will leave you with detail missing (clipping) in your highlights or shadows. As always, it is safest to bracket.

How do you capture a scene when the contrast is too great for your camera? What do you do when the highlights are too bright and the shadows too dark to be captured at the same time? 
The range of tones a sensor or film can capture (or a monitor can display or a printer can print) is called its dynamic range. 
When exposing a scene with too much contrast - too great a dynamic range - you can only make sure the most important tones are recorded, you can’t capture all of them in one picture. 

The shape of the curve (or of any section) indicates contrast. A steeper slope is higher contrast; more horizontal means lower contrast. 
Increasing contrast in one part of the curve means losing it somewhere else.

Contrast and Tone
- Full Scale: Black, White, and Many Tones in between
- High Contrast: Very Dark and Very Light Tones, Few Gray Tones
- Low Contrast: Mostly Gray tones
- High Key: Mostly Light Tones
- Low Key: Mostly Dark Tones

Additional Notes

- Underexposed - Too Dark
- Overexposed - Too Light

.tiff (written TIFF) is a nearly universal format that allows a photograph to be opened on any computer by nearly every program that works with photographs. 
Saving a file as a TIFF makes no changes to it (it is called lossless), nor does its optional compression mode (LZW). A TIFF can be 8- or 16-bit. 

.dng (Digital Negative) is an open source (no owner, publicly available) format developed by Adobe in the hope that camera makers would standardize their now-proprietary formats. 
Adobe’s software, or their free utility, will let you convert any Camera Raw file into a .dng, which may eventually become the standard Camera Raw format.

Lightroom 

1.) What is a histogram and what does it look like? 

A histogram is a graphical representation of the tonal values of your image. In other words, it shows the amount of tones of particular brightness found in your photograph ranging
from black (0% brightness) to white (100% brightness). As shown in the image below, dark tones are displayed on the left side of the histogram.
As you move rightward, tones get lighter. The middle portion of the histogram represents midtones, which are neither dark nor light. 
Vertical axis of a histogram displays the amount of tones of that particular lightness. 
Histogram is exposure-dependent, but is also affected by tone curve and other settings.

Where do you find it to manipulate it in Lightroom? 
In Lightroom, you can find the histogram at the top of the right-hand panel. If your shadows are clipped, the gray triangle in the left corner of the histogram will turn white.
App - In the top right corner, for more options, under View Options.

2.) Why is it better to convert to Black & White in Lightroom than in camera?

When deciding on how to shoot black and white photography, my advice is always to shoot in raw and convert to black and white afterwards.
In this way, you have more choices and you will always produce an image with the maximum amount of quality that your camera can produce.

3.) Why is it best to have only one Lightroom catalog?

For typical Lightroom use, you should NOT be using multiple catalogs. Using multiple catalogs can slow down your workflow, hinder your ability to organize your photos,
increase the chances for file corruption, and give you no actual benefits.
...because it takes a LOT longer to open and close multiple catalogs than it ever would to keyword search even the most massive of Lightroom catalogs.
...One Catalog Makes It Easier To Find Images Quickly
...If you Really Need To Separate Photos, Use Folders Instead
...Multiple Catalogs could only be beneficial if you need to backup your data.  

4.) What does the adjustment brush do?

To make local corrections in Lightroom Classic...
The Adjustment Brush tool lets you selectively apply Exposure, Clarity, Brightness, and other adjustments to photos by "painting" them onto the photo.
... the adjustment tool selects and modifies specific image areas.

(Adjustment Brush tool only) Specify options for Adjustment Brush A:
- Size: Specifies the diameter of the brush tip in pixels.
- Feather: Creates a soft-edged transition between the brushed area and the surrounding pixels. 
When you use the brush, the distance between the inner and outer circle represents the feather amount.
- Flow: Controls the rate of application of the adjustment.
- Auto Mask: Confines brush strokes to areas of similar color.
- Density: Controls the amount of transparency in the stroke.

Choose the type of adjustment you want to make from the Effect pop-up menu, or drag the sliders:
- Temp: Adjusts the color temperature of an area of the image, making it warmer or cooler. 
A graduated filter temperature effect can improve images captured in mixed-lighting conditions.
- Tint: Compensates for a green or magenta color cast
- Exposure: Sets the overall image brightness. 
Applying an Exposure local correction can achieve results similar to traditional dodging and burning.
- Contrast: Adjusts image contrast, mainly affecting midtones
- Highlights: Recovers detail in overexposed highlight areas of an image
- Shadows: Recovers detail in underexposed shadow areas of an image
- Whites: Adjusts the white points in a photo
- Blacks: Adjusts the black points in a photo
- Texture: Smoothens or accentuates textured details in your photo. Move the slider to the left to smoothen details; 
move it to the right to accentuate details. When you adjust the Texture slider, the color or tonality does not change.
- Clarity: Adds depth to an image by increasing local contrast
- Dehaze: Reduces or increases existing haze in a photo
- Hue: Adjusts the hue in a photo. Select Use Fine Adjustment for precise adjustments.
- Saturation: Adjusts the vividness of the color
- Sharpness: Enhances edge definition to bring out details in the photo. A negative value blurs details.
- Noise: Reduces luminance noise, which can become apparent when shadow areas are opened.
- Moiré: Removes moiré artifacts, or color aliasing
- Defringe: Removes fringe colors along edges
- Color: Applies a tint to the area affected by the local correction. Select the hue by clicking the Color swatch. 
The Color effect is preserved if you convert the photo to black and white.
- Other effects: Additional effects are available for specific tasks, such as whitening teeth, enhancing irises, or softening skin tones.
Note: If Burn (Darken), Dodge (Lighten), Iris Enhance, Soften Skin, or Teeth Whitening is not available, 
choose Lightroom Classic > Preferences (Mac OS) or Edit > Preferences (Windows). 
In the Presets panel, click Restore Local Adjustment Presets.

5.) Why do you never have to "save" edits in Lightroom?

It saves automatically...

 Notes from Book

- The shorter the focal length of the lens, the greater the depth of field (no blurred background). 
- The smaller the aperture (f/16; with a given lens), the greater the depth of field (no blurred background). 

- The farther you are from a subject, the greater the depth of field (no blurred background).
- A lens with variable or adjustable focal-length lens is called a zoom lens.
- Aperture or F-stops (the size of the lens opening), controls the amount of light that passes through the lens. 
The lower the F-stops, the wider the lens opening and the more light that is let in.

Photography Notes

The shutter speed determines the length of time that light strikes the sensor.
The aperture size determines how bright the light is that passes through the lens and shutter to the light sensitive surface.

Shutter Speed
-Moving objects can be shown crisply sharp, frozen in mid motion, or blurred either a little bit or a lot. The faster the shutter speed, the sharper the moving object will appear. 

Aperture Control
-Do you want part of the picture sharp and part out of focus or do you want the whole picture sharp from foreground to back-ground? Changing the size of the aperture (the lens opening) is one way to control sharpness. The smaller the aperture, the more of the picture that will be sharp. 

(M) - Manual Exposure
-You set both the shutter speed and aperture yourself.
-You can use a camera’s built-in meter for manual exposure. Point the camera at the most important part of the scene and activate the meter. The viewfinder will show whether the exposure is correct. If it isn't, change the shutter speed and/or aperture until it is. In this example, plus numbers signal overexposure, minus means under exposure. Lining up the red arrow with the dot in the center indicates the exposure is right. 
-To prevent blur caused by the camera moving during the exposure (if the camera is not on a tripod), select a shutter speed of at least (1/60) sec. A shutter speed of (1/25) sec. is safer. 

(Auto) - Automatic Exposure
-The camera sets the shutter speed or aperture, or both, for you. 
-With Automatic Exposure, each time you press the shutter release button, the camera automatically meters the light, then sets both shutter speed and aperture. 

(S) - Shutter Priority Automatic Exposure
-You set the shutter speed and the camera sets the aperture. To prevent blur rom camera motion if you are hand holder the camera, select a shutter speed of (1/60) sec. or faster.

(A) - Aperture Priority Automatic Exposure
-You set the aperture and the camera sets the shutter speed. To keep the picture sharp when you hand hold the camera, check that the shutter speed is (1/60) sec. or faster. If it is not, set the aperture to a larger opening (a smaller f-number).
