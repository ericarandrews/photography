Photography Study Guide

Camera

1.) What is the ISO setting? 

ISO speed (100, 200, 400, and so on) describes a sensor’s (or film’s) sensitivity to light. 
What are the typical ISO settings? The higher the number, the less light it needs for a correct 
exposure (for a picture that is not too light or too dark). With a digital camera, 
you may select an ISO setting within that camera’s range. You may choose a different ISO for each picture, 
or you may set your camera to do so automatically. Lower numbers will generally result in higher-quality pictures. 
Set an ISO of 50-800 for shooting outdoors in sunny conditions. In dimmer light, such as indoors, use an ISO of 800 or higher.
Film is made with a fixed ISO; an entire roll must be exposed at that speed; 400 speed film is a good all-purpose choice. 

2.) What are the visual characteristics of fast vs. slow ISOs? 

Fast (Higher) vs Slow (Lower) ISOs, on a digital camera,
will change either aperture or shutter speed but will not make the picture lighter or darker. 
(Instead, you will need to use the button, dial, or menu item that controls exposure compensation. 
You can set the camera to expose all your photographs at a fixed amount more or less than the meter indicates, 
or you can make an exposure change for one picture at a time.)
