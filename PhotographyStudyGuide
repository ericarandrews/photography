Camera

1.) What is the ISO setting? 

ISO speed (100, 200, 400, and so on) describes a sensor’s (or film’s) sensitivity to light. 
What are the typical ISO settings? The higher the number, 
the less light it needs for a correct exposure (for a picture that is not too light or too dark). 
With a digital camera, you may select an ISO setting within that camera’s range. 
You may choose a different ISO for each picture, or you may set your camera to do so automatically. 
Lower numbers will generally result in higher-quality pictures. 
Set an ISO of 50-800 for shooting outdoors in sunny conditions. 
In dimmer light, such as indoors, use an ISO of 800 or higher. 
Film is made with a fixed ISO; an entire roll must be exposed at that speed; 
400 speed film is a good all-purpose choice. 

2.) What are the visual characteristics of fast vs. slow ISOs? 

Fast (Higher) vs Slow (Lower) ISOs, on a digital camera, 
will change either aperture or shutter speed but will not make the picture lighter or darker. 
(Instead, you will need to use the button, dial, or menu item that controls exposure compensation. 
You can set the camera to expose all your photographs at a fixed amount more or less than the meter indicates, 
or you can make an exposure change for one picture at a time.)

In a digital photograph, the lower the light, the more the noise. Higher ISO settings increase noise. 
Therefore, the higher (faster) the ISO, the lower the light. With a higher ISO, 
you shoot with a smaller aperture or higher shutter speed. 
The kinds of noise that are always present at a low level are then amplified more than they would be at a lower ISO, 
and form a more noticeable part of the image.

Setting the ISO on a film camera doesn’t change the light sensitivity of the film, 
so you can change the exposure (if the camera allows you to set an ISO manually) by changing the film speed setting. 
The camera responds as if the film were slower or faster than it really is. Doubling the film speed (for example, 
from ISO 100 to ISO 200) darkens the picture by decreasing the exposure one stop. 
Halving the film speed (say from ISO 400 to ISO 200) lightens the picture by increasing the exposure one stop. 

3.) What does the shutter speed control? 

The shutter speed determines the length of time that light strikes the sensor. 
Moving objects can be shown crisply sharp, frozen in mid motion, or blurred either a little bit or a lot. 
The faster (higher) the shutter speed, the sharper the moving object will appear. 
To make the correct exposure, so that your picture is neither too light nor too dark, 
you need to control the amount of light that reaches the digital image sensors (or film). 
The shutter speed (the amount of time the shutter remains open) is one of two controls your camera has over the amount of light. 
The aperture size is the other. In addition to controlling the amount of light that enters the camera, 
the shutter speed also affects the way that moving objects are shown. 

4.) What are the visual differences of 1/30 vs 1/1000? 

1/30 - (Slow to Medium Shutter Speed) - The background will be slightly fuzzy but the middle ground might appear in focus. 
Any moving objects in front might show a little blur.   

1/1000 - (Fast Shutter Speed) - The background will definitely be out of focus and the middle ground will be blurred. 
Any moving objects in front will be sharp and any objects in front should be sharp as well.
