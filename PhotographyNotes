Photography Notes


The shutter speed determines the length of time that light strikes the sensor.
The aperture size determines how bright the light is that passes through the lens and shutter to the light sensitive surface.

Shutter Speed
-Moving objects can be shown crisply sharp, frozen in mid motion, or blurred either a little bit or a lot. The faster the shutter speed, the sharper the moving object will appear. 

Aperture Control
-Do you want part of the picture sharp and part out of focus or do you want the whole picture sharp from foreground to back-ground? Changing the size of the aperture (the lens opening) is one way to control sharpness. The smaller the aperture, the more of the picture that will be sharp. 

(M) - Manual Exposure
-You set both the shutter speed and aperture yourself.
-You can use a cameraâ€™s built-in meter for manual exposure. Point the camera at the most important part of the scene and activate the meter. The viewfinder will show whether the exposure is correct. If it isn't, change the shutter speed and/or aperture until it is. In this example, plus numbers signal overexposure, minus means under exposure. Lining up the red arrow with the dot in the center indicates the exposure is right. 
-To prevent blur caused by the camera moving during the exposure (if the camera is not on a tripod), select a shutter speed of at least (1/60) sec. A shutter speed of (1/25) sec. is safer. 

(Auto) - Automatic Exposure
-The camera sets the shutter speed or aperture, or both, for you. 
-With Automatic Exposure, each time you press the shutter release button, the camera automatically meters the light, then sets both shutter speed and aperture. 

(S) - Shutter Priority Automatic Exposure
-You set the shutter speed and the camera sets the aperture. To prevent blur rom camera motion if you are hand holder the camera, select a shutter speed of (1/60) sec. or faster.

(A) - Aperture Priority Automatic Exposure
-You set the aperture and the camera sets the shutter speed. To keep the picture sharp when you hand hold the camera, check that the shutter speed is (1/60) sec. or faster. If it is not, set the aperture to a larger opening (a smaller f-number).
